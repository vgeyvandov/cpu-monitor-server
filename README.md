The CPU monitor server is an express-based API with endpoints to get the CPU count and the average CPU load.

In the `cpu-monitor-server` directory, run `npm install && npm start` to set up and start the service. The service will run on `http://localhost:3001`. The server supports `eslint` commands via `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix`.
